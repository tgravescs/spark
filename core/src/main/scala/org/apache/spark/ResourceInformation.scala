/**
 * Class to hold information about a type of Resource. A resource could be a GPU, FPGA, etc.
 * The array of addresses are resource specific and its up to the user to interpret the address.
 * The units and addresses could be empty if they doesn't apply to that resource.
 *
 * One example is GPUs, where the addresses would be the indices of the GPUs, the count would be the
 * number of GPUs and the units would be an empty string.
 *
 * @param name the name of the resource
 * @param units the units of the resources, can be an empty string if units don't apply
 * @param count the number of resources available
 * @param addresses an optional array of strings describing the addresses of the resource
